            <p id="surprise-message" class="hidden">I just wanted to check in and see if you’re doing okay. I hope life is treating you well. It’s been hard to move forward without you, and I won’t lie – I’m still carrying some of the weight of what happened.

                The way you left without looking back made me feel like I wasn’t enough, and I still struggle with it sometimes. But I know I have to let go now, for my own peace. I’m wishing you the best, and I hope you take care of yourself. You deserve to find what makes you happy.
                
                Goodbye, and I hope you find the healing you need, just like I’m trying to do.
                
                Take care of yourself! ❤️</p>
